<h5>Calculating the area under the curve:</h5>
<p>The Empirical Rule is an estimate of probability and is limited to questions involving values with z scores of whole numbers.   We need to use technology to accurately calculate probabilities (areas) for other z-scores.</p>

<li>If z = -1.32, what is area to the left of the z score?

<li>According to MarathonGuide.com, in 2010 the average time it took to run a marathon was about 4.5 hours with a standard deviation of about 1 hour.

<li>Find the z-score for a runner who finishes in 3.2 hours
    <inline class="solution">\(z_{32}=\frac{3.2-4.5}{1}=-1.3\)</inline>
    <p>What does this z-score mean in words:

    <p>What does this z-score mean in words:

</li>

<li>Would you consider someone who finishes a marathon in 2 hours and 15 minutes to be very fast?  What would their z-score be and what does that mean?
<p class="solution">2 hours and 15 minutes = 2.25 hours  (because 15 minutes is ¼ of an hour)</p>
<p class="solution">\(z_{2.25}=\frac{2.25-4.5}{1}=-2.25\)</p>
<p class="solution">A runner’s time of 2.25 hours is 2.25 standard deviations below the mean time of 4.5 hours.  This runner’s time would be more than 2 standard deviations below the mean and would be considered unusually fast.</p>

  <p class="solution">The 99% confidence interval (#2) is wider because as the confidence level increases, the margin of error increases as well.</p>
