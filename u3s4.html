      <h2>3.4 Confidence Intervals for Population Proportions</h2>

   

  According to the final New York Times/CBS News presidential pre-election poll in November 2000, among people likely to vote, George W. Bush drew 46% and Al Gore 41%.  Yet, Mr. Bush’s advantage was considered statistically insignificant.  The national poll included 862 likely voters and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.  
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/06/us/the-2000-campaign-the-polls-poll-shows-either-candidate-within-reach-of-victory.html"></a>
  <br><br>
  <ol>
    <li> According to the poll, the percentage of likely voters who planned to vote for Mr. Bush was 46% +/- 3%.
      <ol>
        <li> What was the best point estimate for the percentage of likely voters supporting Mr. Bush?  
<inline class="solution">46%</inline>
        </li>
        <li> What was the lower limit of the confidence interval for Bush voters?  
          <inline class="solution">46% - 3% = 43%</inline>
        </li>
        <li> What was the upper limit of the confidence interval for Bush voters?  
          <inline class="solution">46% + 3% = 49%</inline>
        </li>
        <li> Write the confidence interval for the percentage of Bush voters using interval notation.  
          <inline class="solution">(43%, 49%)</inline>
        </li>
        <li> Graph the confidence interval on a number line and label the best point estimate and the margin of error.

      </ol>

    <p style="page-break-before: always"></p>
<li> According to the poll, 41% of likely voters planned to vote for Mr. Gore, with a 3% margin of error.
  <ol>
    <li> What was the lower limit of the confidence interval for Gore voters?  
      <inline class="solution">41% - 3% = 38%</inline>
    </li>
    <li> What was the upper limit of the confidence interval for Gore voters?  
      <inline class="solution">41% + 3% = 44%</inline>
    </li>
    <li> Write the confidence interval for the percentage of Gore voters using interval notation.  
      <inline class="solution">(38%, 44%)</inline>
    </li>
    <li> Write the confidence interval for the percentage of Gore voters in the form \(\hat{p}\pm E\).     
      <inline class="solution">\(41\%\pm3\%\) or \(0.41\pm 0.03\)</inline>
    </li>
    <li> Graph the confidence interval on a number line and label the best point estimate and the margin of error.

    </li>
  </ol>
</li> 
<li>Why was Mr. Bush’s advantage considered statistically insignificant?  
  <p class="solution">Because taking into account the margin of error, the confidence intervals for each candidate’s vote overlapped.  For example, 43.5% of the vote was within the confidence interval for both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore.</p>

<li> According to a Pew Research Center survey of 1,453 U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 and their parents conducted in 2023, the confidence interval for the percentage of teens who say their parent is at least sometimes distracted by their phone when they’re trying to talk to them is (42.8%, 49.2%).
  <ol>
    <li> What is the lower limit of the confidence interval?

    <li> What is the margin of error in the survey? 
      <inline class="solution">49.2% - 46% = 3.2%</inline>
    </li>
    <li> If the confidence level of the survey was 99%, how should we interpret the confidence interval (42.8%, 49.2%)?  
      <inline class="solution">We are 99% confident that the true percentage of U.S. teens who say their parents are at least sometimes distracted by their phone when they’re trying to talk to them is between 42.8% and 49.2%.</inline>
    </li>
    <li> Could the true percentage of teens who say their parent is at least sometimes distracted by their phone be 48%?  How do you know?  
      <inline class="solution">Yes, because 48% is between 42.8% and 49.2%.</inline>

<b>When constructing a confidence interval, we use data from a sample to estimate information about the population.  For a population proportion, we use the binomial theorem to approximate a normal distribution and therefore use z-scores when constructing the confidence interval.  The sample must be large enough so that the number of successes and failures are both greater than 5.</b>

<li> For a class project, a political science student at a large university wants to estimate the percent of students at their university who are registered voters.  The student surveys 500 students and finds that 300 are registered voters.

    <li>For a class project, a political science student at a large university wants to estimate the percent of students who are registered voters.  The student surveys 500 students and finds that 300 are registered voters.  

        <ol>
        
        <li>What is the best point estimate of the population proportion of students who are registered voters?
          <p class="solution">\(\hat{p}=\frac{x}{n}=\frac{300}{500}=0.60\)</p>

    <li>Use the sample data to construct a 90% confidence interval estimate of the percentage of students who are registered voters.
    <p class="solution">(0.5640, 0.6360)</p>
</li>
