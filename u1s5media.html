      <ol>
       
<li> An instructor assigns MATH 1530 students in the class to poll 11 randomly selected people on campus with the following question:  “On average, how many hours per day do you spend playing video games?”  Analyze the responses.  
  
        <img src="images/u1s5p2a.png" alt="Data for Student A: A number line that goes from 0 to 11 counting by one. There are six dots above the 0, two dots above the 1, 1 dot above the 2, one dot above the 4 and one dot above the 10. Mean = 1.64, Median = 0 and Standard Deviation = 2.9 is written above the number line.">
        <img src="images/u1s5p2b.png" alt="Data for Student B: A number line that goes from 0 to 11 counting by one. There is one dot above the 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. There are two dots above the 4. Mean = 4.55, Median = 4 and Standard Deviation = 2.9 is written above the number line.">
        <img src="images/u1s5p2c.png" alt="Data for Student C: A number line that goes from 0 to 11 counting by one. There are three dots above the 3, six dots above the 4 and two dots above the 5. Mean = 3.91, Median = 4 and Standard Deviation = 0.67 is written above the number line.">

                <li>Graph may be drawn to the correct height, but the brain perceives area.</li>
            </ul>  

                <img src="images/u1s5mg1.png" alt="A picture of three separate graphs depicting some unknown characteristic, A and B. On each graph, the horizontal axis represents each characteristics A and B. The vertical axis represents the number of people possessing each characteristic and is labeled from 0 to 3, counting by 1. Since each graph is a pictograph, an image of a person represents the number of people with Characteristic A or B. The first graph is titled Improper Scaling. In this graph, image A reaches the number 1 and is very small in width. Image B reaches the 3 and is very large in width. The second graph is titled Regular. In this graph, Image A reaches the number 1. Image B is depicted as the same size as image A, but there are three of them stacked on top of each other and they reach the number 3. The third graph is titled Comparison. In this graph, the improper scaling example is used again with only the small images. Image A reaches the number 1 and is very small in width. Image B reaches the number three and is very wide. It takes 9 of the small image from A to fill the area taken up by the large image for B.  This is misleading in that it indicates that B is 9 times larger than A instead of 3 times larger than A.">
        </li>
        <li>Bar graphs/Line graphs:
            <ul>
                <li>Check for y-axis starting at 0.	Otherwise differences are exaggerated. </li>
                <li>Check that y-axis has a consistent and appropriate scale.</li>
                <li>Check that there is not a “break” in the y-axis. </li>

            <img src="images/u1s5mg2.png" alt="A bar graph depicting the percentage of trucks sold over the last ten years that are still on the road. The horizontal axis represents each of the 4 trucks: Chevy, Ford, Toyota and Nissan/Datsun. The vertical axis represents the percentage and ranges from 95-100, counting by 1. The Chevy Bar is at 98.5%, the Ford bar is at 97.5%, the Toyota bar is at 96.5% and the Nissan/Datsun bar is at 95.5%. This is what is written below the graph in large bold lettering. More than 98% of all Chevy trucks sold in te last 10 years are still on the road. In much cmaller bold lettering is, 'Over the years, no other truck is that dependable, foreign or domestic.' In even smaller lettering is, 'Best full-size pickup in initial quality.' Additionally, 'Best truck line overall in sales satisfaction.'Both of these quotes are credited to J.D. Power and Associates. Also stated is, No deductible, 3-year/36,000-mile Bumper to Bumper Plus Warranty.' In larger bold lettering below the three quotes is Chevrolet. The Most Dependable, Longest-Lasting Trucks. And finally, in extremely large and bold lettering is LIKE A ROCK. In order to accurately represent the data, the vertical axis should be numbered from 1 to 100.">

A note at the bottom of the graph says, 'In the misleading pie chart, Item C appears to be at least as large as Item A, whereas in actuality, it is less than half as large.' The second pie chart is labeled as the Regular Pie Chart. It is a one dimensional chart representing Items A-D with the same percentages as in the misleading pie chart. However, in this chart, Item C looks like it is only 5% of the pie and Item A looks like it is 11% of the pie.">

There are 4 medals drawn and the count is 615. The fourth country is France. There are 3 medals drawn and the count is 523. The fifth country is Germany. There are 2 medals drawn and the count is 499. A note at the bottom of the graph says, 'This medal count was based on the records of Agence France-Press news service and may vary from other accounts. Initially, the International Olympic Committee frowned upon national medal counts and early reports are incomplete. In fact, from 1896 to 1906, athletes registered as individuals and it was not uncommon for them to play on the teams of other countries.'">
