<h3>The Normal bell curve is a distribution of individual x values which are measures for each member of a population.  The mean and standard deviation will vary for each population.</h3>


<li>The distribution of IQ scores is normally distributed with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15.  An Oregon couple claimed their two children were taken away from them because they scored too low on an IQ test.  She scored 72 and he scored 66.  Find the probability that a randomly selected IQ score will be below 73	
  <p>\(\mu = \)
  <inline class="solution">100</inline></p>
  <p>\(\sigma = \)
  <inline class="solution">15</inline></p>
  <p class="solution">\(z_{73}=\frac{73-100}{15}=-1.8\)</inline></p>
  <p class="solution">\(P(x \lt 73)=P(z \lt -1.8)=0.0359\)</p>
    
  <b>Writing your final statement:  </b>

  <p>If one  __________ is randomly selected, the probability the/their __________ is
          <b>lessthan/greaterthan/between</b>____________is approximately equal to ______.	
          </p>
  

  <p class="solution">If one person’s IQ score is randomly selected, the probability their score is less than 73 is approximately equal to 0.0359 or 3.59%.</p>
  </li>


  <li>Are the IQ scores of the couple unusual? (Hint: Calculate z-score for each.)
  <p class="solution">\(z_{72}=\frac{72-100}{15}=-1.87\)</p>
  <p class="solution">\(z_{66}=\frac{66-100}{15}=-2.27\)</p>
  <p class="solution">Her IQ is not unusual, but his is unusual.</p>

<li>To determine the average wait time at Taco Bell in the Miami area, 16 graduate students randomly selected 16 Taco Bell stores.  Each student visited a Taco Bell store at 12:15 pm and ordered a crunchy beef taco, a burrito supreme, and a soda.  The wait time to receive the meal was recorded for each restaurant.  The distribution is normal with a mean of 22.4 minutes and a standard deviation of 6.2 minutes.

  <ol>
  
  <li>If one Taco Bell is randomly selected, what is the probability the wait time will be more than 20 minutes?
    <p class="solution">\(z=\frac{20-22.4}{6.2}=-0.3871\)</p>
    <p class="solution">\(P(x>20)=P(z>-0.3871)=.6506\)</p>
    <p class="solution">If one Taco Bell is randomly selected, the probability the student's wait time was more than 20 minutes is approximately equal to 0.6506 or 65.06%.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>If one Taco Bell is randomly selected, what is the probability the wait time will be between 25 minutes and 35 minutes?
    <p class="solution">\(z_{25}=\frac{25-22.4}{6.2} \approx 0.4194\)</p>
    <p class="solution">\(z_{35}=\frac{35-22.4}{6.2} \approx 2.0322\)</p>
    <p class="solution">\(P(25 \lt x \lt 35)=P(.419 \lt z \lt 2.0322)=.3164\)</p>
    <p class="solution">If one Taco Bell is randomly selected, the probability the student's wait time was between 25 and 35 minutes is approximately equal to 0.3164 or 31.64%.</p>
